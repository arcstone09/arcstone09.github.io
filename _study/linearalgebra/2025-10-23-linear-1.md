This lecture note is includes chapter 1 ~ 6 of <u>*Linear Algebra_Friedberg_5th edition*</u>.

This lecture note would be kept updated until it fully covers the book (~ chap 7).



# Midterm

Below is the midterm exam for Linear Algebra 2 class which covers chapter 6. 

1. For vectorspace $V=R^3$, consist the orthonormal basis for the subspace $W = [(x, y, z) | x + 2y + 3z = 0]$.

   

2. For any orthogonal matrix $A \in M_{3 \times 3}(R)$, show that there exists orthogonal matrix $P$ such that 

   $$
   PAP^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) \\
   0 & sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) \\
   \end{pmatrix}
   $$




3. $T$ is a rigid motion on $R^n$, which means, $||T(x)-T(y)|| = ||x-y||$ for $\forall x, y \in R^n$  $T(0)=0$. 

â€‹	(1) Show that $<T(v), T(w)> = <v, w>$. 
â€‹	(2) Show that $T$ is a linear operator. 



4. Let $V$ be an inner product space, and let $T$ be a normal operator on $V$. Prove that If $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}$ are distince eigenvector of $T$, then their eigenspaces are orthogonal. 

   

5. Solve the questions below. 

   (1) For the following matrix $A$, find an orthogonal matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $P*AP=D$ 
   $$
   \begin{pmatrix}
   2 & -2 \\
   -2 & 5 \\
   \end{pmatrix}
   $$
   

   (2) Explain whether (0, 0) is an extremal points for $f(x,y)=2x^2 -4xy+ 5y^2$.

     

6. Find a singular value decomposition for the matrix below.
   $$
   \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 & -1 \\
   2 & 0 & -2 \\
   \end{pmatrix}
   $$
