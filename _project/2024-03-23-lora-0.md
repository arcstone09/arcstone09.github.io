In this post, a brief overview of LoRa Demodulator/Decoder Project is shown.

# What is LoRa?

LoRa, which stands for Long Range, is a wireless communication technology developed for low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs). It enables long-range communication with low power consumption, making it ideal for applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, industrial automation, and agricultural monitoring. In particular, LoRa is a modulation technique used at the physical layer (PHY) of the communication stack. It employs a spread-spectrum modulation technique called Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) to achieve long-range communication.

# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to accurately demodulate and decode LoRa signals. This process entails learning about digital signal processing theory, channel coding, AES encryption methods, and the OSI 7 Layer model, and then implementing them in code.
